                            for self-expression — and what better form of expression than a tattoo that tells your unique
                            story?
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}>If you’re searching for tattoo studios in Koregaon Park, Pune, you’ll find several options. But just

                                Nestled in a charming bungalow just 2.5 km from Koregaon Park, Moulee’s Tattoo Art Studio
                                offers a peaceful alternative to the often-busy, commercial tattoo spaces found in high-traffic
                                areas. Unlike studios located inside malls or market complexes, this studio sits inside an artist’s
                                home — filled with nature, calm energy, and soulful vibes.
                            </p>

                                adorning the walls. It’s not just a studio, but an experience.

                                literally. The bungalow doubles as an art gallery, where you can
                                experience <strong>paintings, sketches, sculptures</strong>, and
                                spiritual installations that reflect the philosophy behind the

                                    While Koregaon Park tattoo shops are mostly in commercial areas, Moulee’s is tucked inside a
                                    peaceful bungalow just a few minutes away. That short distance transforms your experience
                                    from “transactional” to “transformational.”

                                    Other studios may ask what design you want. Moulee asks <strong>why</strong> you want it. Every tattoo
                                    becomes a deeply personal collaboration — not just a trendy design pulled from Pinterest.
