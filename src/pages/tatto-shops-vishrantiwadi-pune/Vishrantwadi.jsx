            <p>
              Behind this soulful experience is{" "}
              <strong>Narendra, lovingly known as Moulee</strong> — an

            <p>
              Moulee doesn’t believe in rushing or replicating trendy designs.
              For him, tattooing is a<strong>collaborative ritual</strong>, not
              just a service. He listens deeply, understands your emotion, and
              translates it into a <strong>bespoke design</strong> that
              resonates with your essence.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Every tattoo I create is like a spiritual fingerprint. It’s not
              just ink — it’s intention.” – Moulee
            </p>

            <p>
              He works <strong>one-on-one with every client</strong>, never
              outsourcing or assigning designs to assistants. From ideation to
              aftercare, your journey is fully guided and supported by the
              artist himself.

                  custom-made based on your story, emotion, and energy. Whether
                  it's a small meaningful symbol or a large intricate piece,
